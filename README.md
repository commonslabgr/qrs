Queue Remote System

A web system that collects data from current queue management systems in public offices and serves the open data either through simple JSON or through beautiful widgets.

Users will be able to see what is the last printed ticket of their local post office, or other connected offices, what is the customer number being currently served and the estimated waiting time from now till the last issued ticket. they can view a local map with the location and contact information of the office and even ask for notification through SMS or email when an issued number is closed to be served.
This will help everyone to manage their time better, saving many working hours not being wasted waiting in queues.
Also it will help the employees as they will not have to deal with too many frstrated customers, since the customers now will be better informed about the waiting and avoid frustration. Leading to an improved overall experience for both the public and the employees.
The data should be open and thus providing many possibilites after studying them, visualizing them. For example one could gather annual data of a specific post office and manage when and where they need extra employees to offer better service.
